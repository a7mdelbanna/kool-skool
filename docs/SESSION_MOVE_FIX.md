# Session Move Functionality - Fixed Issues Documentation

## Date: September 9, 2025

## Problem Summary
The session move functionality had multiple critical issues that have been successfully resolved.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Date Calculation for Moved Sessions**
**Problem**: When moving session #2 (Friday, Sept 5) from a 12-session subscription, it was incorrectly placing the moved session on September 15th instead of October 1st (after the subscription ends on Sept 29).

**Root Cause**: The `latestDate` was being initialized to `new Date()` (current date) instead of finding the actual last session date.

**Solution**: Implemented proper calculation based on subscription parameters:
- Start date
- Total sessions
- Sessions per week
- Calculated the exact end date by counting through all sessions sequentially

### 2. **Field Naming Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: System was only finding 2-3 sessions instead of all 12 due to Firebase field naming inconsistencies (`subscription_id` vs `subscriptionId`).

**Solution**: Modified queries to check BOTH field naming conventions and combine results using a Map to avoid duplicates.

### 3. **Sessions Missing Scheduled Dates**
**Problem**: Most sessions didn't have `scheduled_date` field populated, making date calculations impossible.

**Solution**: Calculate end date from subscription parameters instead of relying on individual session dates.

### 4. **Moved Session Placed on Last Date Instead of After**
**Problem**: Moved sessions were being placed on the last session date (Sept 29) instead of after it.

**Solution**: Fixed calculation to properly count sessions sequentially and place moved sessions after the subscription ends.

### 5. **Replacement Session Not Appearing in UI**
**Problem**: The replacement session wasn't showing up in the UI after being created.

**Solution**: Added BOTH field naming conventions (underscore and camelCase) to all fields in the replacement session to ensure compatibility with all queries.

### 6. **Generic "Moved to another date" Text**
**Problem**: 
- Original moved session showed "[Moved to another date]" instead of the actual date
- Replacement session showed "[Moved from unknown date]" instead of the actual source date

**Solution**: 
- Calculate and display actual dates: "[Moved to Wednesday, October 1, 2025]"
- Show proper source date: "[Moved from Friday, September 5]"

### 7. **Missing Restore Functionality**
**Problem**: No way to restore a moved session back to its original state.

**Solution**: 
- Added restore button for moved sessions
- Restore function finds and deletes the replacement session
- Properly cleans up notes and restores original status

### 8. **Multiple Moved Sessions Stacking Issue**
**Problem**: When moving multiple sessions, they would all be placed on the same date instead of sequential dates.

**Solution**: System now checks for existing moved sessions (replacement sessions) and places new moved sessions after all previously moved sessions.

## Final Implementation Details

### Key Code Changes in `supabaseToFirebase.ts`:

1. **Date Calculation Logic** (lines 1550-1585):
```typescript
// Calculate the date of each session sequentially
let currentDate = new Date(start);
let sessionCount = 0;
let lastSessionDate = new Date(start);

// Move to the first scheduled day from start date
while (!scheduleDays.includes(currentDate.getDay())) {
  currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
}

// Count through all sessions to find the last one
while (sessionCount < totalSessions) {
  if (scheduleDays.includes(currentDate.getDay())) {
    sessionCount++;
    lastSessionDate = new Date(currentDate);
  }
  if (sessionCount < totalSessions) {
    currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
  }
}
```

2. **Checking for Existing Moved Sessions** (lines 1636-1676):
```typescript
// Find any replacement sessions that are after the calculated end date
const replacementSessions = allSessions.filter((s: any) => {
  const isReplacement = s.moved_from_session_id || 
                      (s.notes && s.notes.includes('[Moved from'));
  if (!isReplacement) return false;
  
  const sessionDate = s.scheduled_date || s.scheduledDate;
  if (!sessionDate) return false;
  
  const sDate = new Date(sessionDate);
  return sDate >= latestDate;
});
```

3. **Dual Field Naming Support** (lines 1679-1760):
```typescript
const replacementSession: any = {
  // Use both field naming conventions for subscription ID
  subscription_id: subscriptionId,
  subscriptionId: subscriptionId,
  
  // Schedule information
  scheduled_date: nextDate.toISOString().split('T')[0],
  scheduledDate: nextDate.toISOString().split('T')[0],
  // ... etc for all fields
}
```

4. **Restore Functionality** (lines 1789-1835):
```typescript
case 'restore':
  // Find and delete replacement sessions
  const replacementSessions = await databaseService.query('sessions', {
    where: [{ field: 'moved_from_session_id', operator: '==', value: p_session_id }]
  });
  
  for (const replacementSession of replacementSessions) {
    await databaseService.delete('sessions', replacementSession.id);
  }
  
  // Clean up notes with regex to handle new format
  updates.notes = restoredSession.notes
    .replace(/ \[Moved to [^\]]+\]/g, '') // New format with date
    .replace(' [Moved to another date]', '') // Old format
    .trim();
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **DO NOT MODIFY THE SESSION MOVE LOGIC** - The current implementation is working perfectly and any changes could break the carefully balanced date calculations and field naming compatibility.

## Testing Confirmation
- ✅ Moving session #2 (Sept 5) correctly places it on Oct 1 (after Sept 29 subscription end)
- ✅ Moved session shows "Moved to Wednesday, October 1, 2025"
- ✅ Replacement session shows "Moved from Friday, September 5"
- ✅ Restore button appears and functions correctly
- ✅ Multiple moved sessions stack properly in sequence
- ✅ Both field naming conventions work in all queries

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/migration/supabaseToFirebase.ts` - Main logic
- `/src/components/student-tabs/SessionsTab.tsx` - UI restore button visibility

**Status**: COMPLETE AND WORKING - NO FURTHER CHANGES NEEDED
