# Welcome to your Lovable project

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Firebase Storage Setup Required ðŸš¨

To enable file uploads (payment logos, payment proofs, avatars), you MUST configure Firebase Storage security rules:

### Quick Setup Steps:

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Select your project: `kool-skool-7e858`

2. **Navigate to Storage**
   - Click **Storage** in the left sidebar
   - If first time: Click **Get started**, choose location, select **production mode**

3. **Update Security Rules**
   - Click the **Rules** tab
   - Replace ALL existing rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to read and write payment logos
    match /payment-logos/{schoolId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.resource.size < 2 * 1024 * 1024
        && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read and write payment proofs
    match /payment-proofs/{schoolId}/{studentId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024
        && (request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*') 
            || request.resource.contentType == 'application/pdf');
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to upload avatars
    match /avatars/{schoolId}/{userType}/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.resource.size < 2 * 1024 * 1024
        && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to upload teacher documents
    match /teacher-documents/{schoolId}/{teacherId}/{documentType}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024;
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Click "Publish"** to apply the rules

âœ… **Storage is now configured!** File uploads will work properly.
